LESSON 1: THE RICH DON'T 
WORK FOR MONEY
</pre>

<pre>
The poor and the middle class work for money.
The rich have money work for them.

</pre>

<pre class="page">
“Dad, can you tell me how to get rich?”
My dad put down the evening paper. “Why do you want to get 
rich, Son?”
“Because today Jimmy’s mom drove up in their new Cadillac, and 
they were going to their beach house for the weekend. He took three 
of his friends, but Mike and I weren’t invited. They told us we weren’t 
invited because we were poor kids.”
“They did?” my dad asked incredulously.
“Yeah, they did,” I replied in a hurt tone.
My dad silently shook his head, pushed his glasses up the bridge of his 
nose, and went back to reading the paper. I stood waiting for an answer.
The year was 1956. I was nine years old. By some twist of fate, 
I attended the same public school where the rich people sent their 
kids. We were primarily a sugar-plantation town. The managers of 
the plantation and the other affluent people, such as doctors, business 
owners, and bankers, sent their children to this elementary school. 
After grade six, their children were generally sent off to private 
schools. Because my family lived on one side of the street, I went 
to this school. Had I lived on the other side of the street, I would
</pre>

<pre class="page">
have gone to a different school with kids from families more like 
mine. After grade six, these kids and I would go on to the public 
intermediate and high school. There was no private school for them 
or for me.
My dad finally put down the paper. I could tell he was thinking.
“Well, Son…,” he began slowly. “If you want to be rich, you have 
to learn to make money.”
“How do I make money?” I asked.
“Well, use your head, Son,” he said, smiling. Even then I knew 
that really meant, “That’s all I’m going to tell you,” or “I don’t know 
the answer, so don’t embarrass me.”
A Partnership Is Formed
The next morning, I told my best friend, Mike, what my dad had 
said. As best as I could tell, Mike and I were the only poor kids in this 
school. Mike was also in this school by a twist of fate. Someone had 
drawn a jog in the line for the school district, and we wound up in
school with the rich kids. We weren’t really poor, but we felt as if we 
were because all the other boys had new baseball gloves, new bicycles, 
new everything.
Mom and Dad provided us with the basics, like food, shelter, 
and clothes. But that was about it. My dad used to say, “If you want 
something, work for it.” We wanted things, but there was not much 
work available for nine-year-old boys.
“So what do we do to make money?” Mike asked.
“I don’t know,” I said. “But do you want to be my partner?”
He agreed, and so on that Saturday morning, Mike became my 
first business partner. We spent all morning coming up with ideas 
on how to make money. Occasionally we talked about all the “cool 
guys” at Jimmy’s beach house having fun. It hurt a little, but that hurt 
was good, because it inspired us to keep thinking of a way to make 
money. Finally, that afternoon, a bolt of lightning struck. It was an 
idea Mike got from a science book he had read. Excitedly, we shook 
hands, and the partnership now had a business.
</pre>

<pre class="page">
For the next several weeks, Mike and I ran around our neighborhood, 
knocking on doors and asking our neighbors if they would save their 
toothpaste tubes for us. With puzzled looks, most adults consented with a 
smile. Some asked us what we were doing, to which we replied, “We can’t 
tell you. It’s a business secret.”
My mom grew distressed as the weeks wore on. We had selected a 
site next to her washing machine as the place we would stockpile our 
raw materials. In a brown cardboard box that at one time held catsup 
bottles, our little pile of used toothpaste tubes began to grow.
Finally my mom put her foot down. The sight of her neighbors’ 
messy, crumpled, used toothpaste tubes had gotten to her. “What are you 
boys doing?” she asked. “And I don’t want to hear again that it’s a business 
secret. Do something with this mess, or I’m going to throw it out.”
Mike and I pleaded and begged, explaining that we would soon 
have enough and then we would begin production. We informed her 
that we were waiting on a couple of neighbors to finish their toothpaste 
so we could have their tubes. Mom granted us a one-week extension.
The date to begin production was moved up, and the pressure was 
on. My first partnership was already being threatened with an eviction 
notice by my own mom! It became Mike’s job to tell the neighbors to 
quickly use up their toothpaste, saying their dentist wanted them to 
brush more often anyway. I began to put together the production line.
One day my dad drove up with a friend to see two nine-year-old 
boys in the driveway with a production line operating at full speed. 
There was fine white powder everywhere. On a long table were small 
milk cartons from school, and our family’s hibachi grill was glowing 
with red-hot coals at maximum heat.
Dad walked up cautiously, having to park the car at the base of 
the driveway since the production line blocked the carport. As he and 
his friend got closer, they saw a steel pot sitting on top of the coals in 
which the toothpaste tubes were being melted down. In those days, 
toothpaste did not come in plastic tubes. The tubes were made of 
lead. So once the paint was burned off, the tubes were dropped in the 
small steel pot. They melted until they became liquid, and with my
</pre>

<pre class="page">mom’s pot holders, we poured the lead through a small hole in the 
top of the milk cartons.
The milk cartons were filled with plaster of paris. White powder 
was everywhere. In my haste, I had knocked the bag over, and the 
entire area looked like it had been hit by a snowstorm. The milk 
cartons were the outer containers for plaster of paris molds.
My dad and his friend watched as we carefully poured the molten 
lead through a small hole in the top of the plaster of paris cube.
“Careful,” my dad said.
I nodded without looking up.
Finally, once the pouring was through, I put the steel pot down 
and smiled at my dad.
“What are you boys doing?” he asked with a cautious smile.
“We’re doing what you told me to do. We’re going to be rich,”
I said.
“Yup,” said Mike, grinning and nodding his head. “We’re partners.”
“And what is in those plaster molds?” my dad asked.
“Watch,” I said. “This should be a good batch.”
With a small hammer, I tapped at the seal that divided the cube 
in half. Cautiously, I pulled up the top half of the plaster mold and a 
lead nickel fell out.
“Oh, no!” my dad exclaimed. “You’re casting nickels out of lead!”
“That’s right,” Mike said. “We’re doing as you told us to do. We’re 
making money.”
My dad’s friend turned and burst into laughter. My dad smiled 
and shook his head. Along with a fire and a box of spent toothpaste 
tubes, in front of him were two little boys covered with white dust 
smiling from ear to ear.
He asked us to put everything down and sit with him on the front 
step of our house. With a smile, he gently explained what the word 
“counterfeiting” meant.
Our dreams were dashed. “You mean this is illegal?” asked Mike 
in a quivering voice.</pre>
